I'm currently a senior finishing up my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I previously worked in the aerospace field as an aerodynamicist from various industries. I previously worked with [Prof. Kareem Ahmed](https://mae.ucf.edu/PERL/) as an undergraduate researcher in the [Propulsion and Energy Laboratory](https://mae.ucf.edu/PERL/) at the University of Central Florida. 

Today, with the current state of technology, more software is being implemented into different industries leading to the transformation of workflows and how data is stored and accessed. Previously working in the aerospace industry, I'm inspired to work with modern technology and support the building of large-scale, highly-distributed systems. 

## Education
B.S., Computer Science | University of Central Florida (Aug. 2022 - May 2026)

## Ongoing Projects
### Algorithms for Uncorrelated Track Processing 
Collaborating with Airforce Research Laboratory researchers and a 5-person undergraduate student team to design and benchmark uncorrelated track processing (UCTP) algorithms for satellite data, leveraging the Google Gemini API to query into OpenEvolve LLM and improve evaluation accuracy. Currently we are evaluating through small problem sets to configure functions for UCTP, then convert into larger scale formats in a high-performance computing cluster using Nvidia SuperPOD to test on larger scale datasets.
